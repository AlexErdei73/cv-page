      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a web developer currently living in the UK but originally hailing
        from Hungary. I am also a lifelong learner, who has been interested in
        computers and coding since I was 10 years old, when I learned Basic on
        an old ZX-81 machine. I have worked as a science teacher, a software
        developer, and a freelancer. I believe that my extensive experience with
        an assortment of programming languages paired with my deep understanding
        of current best practices for front-end web development make me a
        competent and resourceful candidate for an entry-level position. My
        website can be seen on with some of my projects.

        <h3>Work History</h3>
        <h4>Freelance web developer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning web development through the Odin Project / January 2020 – present</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the foundation course I learned the basics of web development. This course took me from setting up my local development machine with Linux or macOS operational system to building a simple calculator on a website with Java Script, HTML and CSS. I learned there the fundamental concepts of git, GitHub, text editors (VS Code), and the goal of coding languages in web development. The main emphasize is to give anybody a comprehensive basic knowledge about the main front-end coding languages with teaching good coding practices in Java Script. It also teaches how to debug code, how to ask good questions and all this with learn by doing in a project based manner. The main content of this module can be found here. I also did a pair programming project with another learner, but this project has been removed from the curriculum since that.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the foundations I learned Java Script on advanced level with creating several projects. These projects dealt with intermediate and advanced topics and the
Learning culminated into a final project, which in my case was a simplified Facebook
clone, which uses Firebase back-end. I have chosen to implement this by React, just 
like the original site was built. I also used Bootstrap, react-bootstrap and reactfire to connect the React app with Firebase. The roadmap, which leads here is containing topics like the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OOP in Java Script (constructor function syntax, factory functions and the module pattern, ES6 classes) with strong emphasis given to the SOLID principles, especially 
                to the single responsibility principle and the loose coupling of objects in OOP</li>
            <li>Using webpack to set up a project with dependencies. ES6 modules.</li>
            <li>Creating DOM elements and full webpages with Java Script</li>
            <li>Using webpack to include assets in the bundle. Transpilers, source map.</li>
            <li>Automated unit testing with Jest, TDD development of OOP code, pure functions and 
                their importance></li>
            <li>Java script in practice, menus, forms, carousel components, etc.</li>
            <li>Using web APIs, the REST API. Fetching data from an API. Promises, asynchronous programming in JS, avoiding call-back-hell with promises, JSON response format.</li>
            <li>React basics up to function components and the useState and useEffect hooks</li>
            <li>The React router</li>
            <li>Data driven functional programming in React, the principle of the single source of truth</li>
            <li>Using Firebase as a back-end, Firebase firestore, Firebase storage, Firebase auth and cloud functions</li>
        </ul>
