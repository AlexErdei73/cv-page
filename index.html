      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a web developer currently living in the UK but originally hailing
        from Hungary. I am also a lifelong learner, who has been interested in
        computers and coding since I was 10 years old, when I learned Basic on
        an old ZX-81 machine. I have worked as a science teacher, a software
        developer, and a freelancer. I believe that my extensive experience with
        an assortment of programming languages paired with my deep understanding
        of current best practices for front-end web development make me a
        competent and resourceful candidate for an entry-level position. My
        website can be seen on with some of my projects.

        <h3>Work History</h3>
        <h4>Freelance web developer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning web development through the Odin Project / January 2020 – present</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the foundation course I learned the basics of web development. This course took me
            from setting up my local development machine with Linux or macOS operational system to
            building a simple calculator on a website with Java Script, HTML and CSS. I learned 
            there the fundamental concepts of git, GitHub, text editors (VS Code), and the goal of 
            coding languages in web development. The main emphasize is to give anybody a comprehensive
            basic knowledge about the main front-end coding languages with teaching good coding 
            practices in Java Script. It also teaches how to debug code, how to ask good questions 
            and all this with learn by doing in a project based manner. The main content of 
            this module can be found 
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">here</a>. 
            I also did a pair programming project with another learner, but this project has been removed 
            from the curriculum since that.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the foundations I learned Java Script on advanced level with creating several projects. 
            These projects dealt with intermediate and advanced topics and the learning culminated into a
            final project, which in my case was a simplified Facebook clone, which uses Firebase back-end. 
            I have chosen to implement this by React, just like the original site was built. I also used 
            Bootstrap, react-bootstrap and reactfire to connect the React app with Firebase. The roadmap, 
            which leads here is containing topics like the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>OOP in Java Script (constructor function syntax, factory functions and the module pattern, 
                ES6 classes) with strong emphasis given to the SOLID principles, especially to the single 
                responsibility principle and the loose coupling of objects in OOP</li>
            <li>Using webpack to set up a project with dependencies. ES6 modules.</li>
            <li>Creating DOM elements and full webpages with Java Script</li>
            <li>Using webpack to include assets in the bundle. Transpilers, source map.</li>
            <li>Automated unit testing with Jest, TDD development of OOP code, pure functions and 
                their importance></li>
            <li>Java script in practice, menus, forms, carousel components, etc.</li>
            <li>Using web APIs, the REST API. Fetching data from an API. Promises, asynchronous programming 
                in JS, avoiding call-back-hell with promises, JSON response format.</li>
            <li>React basics up to function components and the useState and useEffect hooks</li>
            <li>The React router</li>
            <li>Data driven functional programming in React, the principle of the single source of truth</li>
            <li>Using Firebase as a back-end, Firebase firestore, Firebase storage, Firebase auth and cloud functions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The full list of topics and projects can be found 
           <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript">here</a>.</p>
        <p>
          With the Odin Project I have strong foundations in front-end development, but still a lot of things 
          are ahead of me in the full-stack comprehensive curriculum. Advanced topics in HTML and CSS, like CSS 
          pre-processors, SASS, fine details of responsive mobile first design, CSS-grid, etc. I also need to 
          learn Express as a back-end framework and how to apply JS on the back-end, which is a complete Node.js 
          course by the Odin project. I also plan to deal with topics, which the Odin project does not supposed 
          to teach, like for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AWS Amplify as an alternative for Firebase. It uses GraphQL API and creates code with better separation 
            of concerns with a ReactUI like Firebase can do with Reactfire. To effectively use this I need to build 
            with it projects and I have some idea for the future regarding it.</li>
          <li>I want to learn how to test front-end React code up to end to end testing. Some companies do not test 
            their front-end code by automated test tools, they only do visual testing. I know it is a relatively 
            difficult topic, because there are tools, which are only built for this purpose. I would like to learn 
            how to use these on the simplest way and what are the real advantages of automated front-end code testing.</li>
          <li>Mobile devices are more and more important, so I would like to get an insight into mobile development 
            through React Native.</li>
          <li>I would also like to learn the newest React tools, like the context API for example.</li>
          <li>I have seen that a state management system like Redux can simplify React code,
            because some other learners used it to their final project. I would like to know how it
            can simplify my React code.</li>
          <li>The first front-end framework happened to be Angular, which I met. I only built a to-do app with it. 
            Angular coding is based on OOP principles; it’s called an MVC framework. What are the real advantages 
            of using it on the front-end compared to React? I know the language is a bit different here from JS, 
            it is a JS flavour, which has more sophisticated OOP tools and can be written more strictly typed code 
            with it than with JS. Why is it applied with React, which is based on different principles than OOP? 
            Is it just fashion or can it simplify the React code significantly?</li>
          <li>How real time data updates do work? They use an OOP design pattern, the Observer pattern or pub-sub 
            pattern. How is it working and why is it so effective? How libraries do work, which use it like rxjs 
            for example?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Started working as a self-taught developer on the following projects:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="https://alexerdei73.github.io/memory-game/">Memory Game</a>
            (05/12/2020 – 17/12/2020)
            <p>
              This is a memory game, where you see pictures of famous theoretical physicists. You are not supposed 
              to click on two times the same picture, because you lose the game. You get interesting quotes from the 
              physicists as long as you don’t lose. The app counts your score as well. It is made by React.

            (24/01/2021 – 21/02/2021)
            <p>
              This is a remake of the Battleship game, where you play against the computer. The application logic is OOP 
              created by TDD. The UI is made by React. There are some animations on the UI created by React and before 
              you start to play, you can rearrange your ships with a drag and drop like effect. Everything works on mobile 
              as well, which was a relatively difficult problem for touch devices, especially because the code is the same 
              for mouse and touch devices.

            <p>
              This is my version of the Where Is Waldo? game. On a photo you need to tag characters, and the program is 
              measuring your time. You are competing with other people, the faster you are the better. This is made by 
              simple HTML, CSS and Java Script in a webpack setup. The back-end is Firebase. Cloud functions are used 
              to make the scoreboard of the gamers secure.

              This is the final project of the Java Script curriculum. It is a fully working Facebook clone with simplified
              functionality. The site works with mobile devices as well, although it is recommended to use on a desktop. 
              The project was created by React with Firebase backend. I used the reactfire library to connect React with 
              Firebase. This library mainly contains custom React hooks for this purpose. When I started the app reactfire 
              was in an experimental state, despite of this the result is nice. If you were curious it is well worth to 
              create an account. You only need an email address to do that, which is going to be verified by Firebase auth. 
              Here is a short YouTube video showing the app.
