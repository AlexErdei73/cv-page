    <p>
      I am a self-trained web developer living in the UK for 13 years, originally hailing
      from Hungary. I have been freelancing for the last free years. I specialize in
      helping software companies and entrepreneurs to solve complex engineering problems
      in short time frames. I have reimplemented beautiful web pages and applications and
      created pixel-perfect, responsive, mobile-first UI-s according to the client's specifications
      and requirements. It is what I am passionate about. I have listed some of my clients and
      websites, which I contributed to, in this CV.
    </p>
    <p>
      My real strength is writing simple, readable and robust JavaScript, that is also modular
      and reusable. This kind of code is a joy to work with for other developers and is easy to maintain.
      The resulting web applications are user-friendly, attractive and easy to understand for users
      with accessibility needs. All this makes things cost-effective in the long run and good for revenue.
      I am an advocate of automated testing and test-driven development(TDD). These modern methods
      help me to achieve simplicity and reliability in the developer team.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I am looking for is a company, that needs a strong JavaScript developer. I could work in
      their strong developer team for our mutual benefit. I can support developers with less
      experience and improve my coding style with the advice of more senior colleagues.
      In my opinion, I can do this work best in the form of a permanent position, but I am open to
      any suggestion.
    </p>

    <p class="project">This app is really kind to my heart, because we made it together with Ben. He is a talented
      JavaScript programmer, but when he was learning asynchronous programming with promises, he was looking for a
      mentor. I took this role happily as a former teacher and developer. The idea came from Ben and I wanted him
      to deal with the JS parts, reviewing his code and trying to direct him to the right direction. I also created
      a simple webpack setup and the HTML and CSS parts of the site. I decided not to go into React with this as he
      did not have any React experience at that point. He has managed to become a React developer since that and
      that makes me very happy, because I could contribute to make him a better developer on his journey.
      Technology: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, fetch API, Promise, asynchronous programming</p>

    <p class="project">This is my blogging website, where other developers can post their blogs after registration or
      like the blog posts. The API is a REST API, which I built with Node and Express. The API is protected with
      JSON Web Tokens. I used passport for the authentication with a passport-jwt strategy. I used the jsonwebtoken npm
      package to digitally sign the tokens. The API also uses the cors library to acomplish CORS. The emphasize is on
      good security practices end error handling. Deployment is Heroku. The front-end is a React app, created with CRA
      and deployed on GitHub pages.</p>

    <h2>Some of my clients</h2>
    <div>Mr Ahmed Matoug</div>
    <div><a href="http://chefahmed.byethost33.com/">http://chefahmed.byethost33.com/</a></div>
    <p class="clients">This is a WordPress site. The client requested to find free hosting for this. It is free but the quality is bad too.
      Nevertheless, the site is still up and running.</p>

    <div>Basement Crowed</div>
    <div><a href="https://github.com/AlexErdei73/pub_fe-challenge">https://github.com/AlexErdei73/pub_fe-challenge</a></div>
    <p class="clients">This is a code challenge, which led a 3 months contribution on a similar UI. The challenge itself
      has never been deployed, but I created a demonstration video, which you can watch if you go to the link. The company
      deals with products, which revolutionise the legal industry.</p>

    <div>EMIS Group</div>
    <div><a href="https://github.com/AlexErdei73/mvp-app">https://github.com/AlexErdei73/mvp-app</a></div>
    <p class="clients">This link is also a code challenge solution. The company dealt with AI solutions in the healthcare
      sector. This simple MVP app led to another short contribution to their product regarding the UI. I am also proud
      because I made an unwanted contribution to the work of the developer, who made the component set, which I used.
      I pointed out an <a href="https://github.com/healthintellect/fhir-ui/issues/1">issue</a>, in one of his component,
      which he has fixed since that. Open source is great.</p>

    <div>Mojeek Ltd</div>
    <p class="clients">Their main product is a search engine, which does not collect information about the user, unlike
      popular search engines. Their CEO, Colin, even tried my Fakebook app and posted a video there about the concerns of
      analyzing CCTV camera information with face recognition software on large scale. Unfortunately I could not work on
      their main product as it requires very strong back-end programming knowledge but they also gave me opportunities in
      some of their side projects.</p>

    <div>Christie and Co.</div>
    <p class="clients">This was an interesting task for me to do. In the interview I was asked if I could copy their
      website. I could have done it using Firebase. My task turned out to be much simpler. The website looked very
      outdated colour wise. I needed to give it a little refreshment, which I happily did.</p>
